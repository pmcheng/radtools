RadTools
========

RadTools is an AutoHotkey script which persists as a tray icon, providing miscellaneous functionality to improve radiologist productivity with Synapse 5 at USC.  It adds the following keybindings:

* Alt-Q: show Synapse 5 PowerJacket
* Alt-W: show Synapse 5 Worklist
* F11: Maximize Synapse 5 Viewer or Worklist across dual displays

There are also several functions not related to Synapse 5, namely:

* Mouse keepalive function, makes periodic tiny movements of the mouse if idle.  This is especially useful for remote sessions in VDI, preventing the VDI session from timing out.
* Citrix keepalive function, periodically sends an F15 keystroke to remote Citrix windows to prevent Citrix from timing out.
